    <h2>Exercise: 3pi in Serial Slave mode</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>When developing more complex application that require additional I/O, more computation capabilities, or communication protocols not supported by the 3pi (e.g. SPI, I2C), it is helpful to use the 3pi as a <a href="https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J21/10.a">Serial Slave</a> of another microcontroller. According to the documentation: &quot;This slave program receives serial data on port PD0 (RX) of the 3pi and transmits responses (when necessary) on port PD1 (TX), using a 115.2 kbaud, TTL-level serial protocol.Â &quot;    </p>
    <p>In this exercise, we will create a robot that will move away if you touch it.</p>
    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Load the Serial Slave program onto your 3Pi Robot</li>
      <li>Devise a way to mount a traditional Arduino (an &quot;Uno&quot;) onto the 3Pi robot; connect the TX/RX pins of the Uno, to the RX/TX pins of the 3pi robot; consider building a parallel plate that mounts on top of the 3pi robot, held up with long machine screws and plastic spacers.</li>
      <li>Connect the I2C gyro/accelerometer from your course kit to the Uno; create a sketch and reads the accellerometer values from this sensor. </li>
      <li>Extend the program so that when the accellerometer readings from the sensor show movements  above a certain threshold, the Uno sends serial commands to the 3Pi robot to make it move away. Refer to the table on <a href="https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J21/10.a">this page from the Pololu site</a> for references on the commands you can send to the 3Pi robot over serial, using the<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SoftwareSerial"> SoftwareSerial</a> library</li>
      <li>Experiment with different choreographies of &quot;moving away&quot;, for instance: a quick/jerky move, and then a 180-degree turn</li></ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>This execise involves integrating a number of important lessons from the past exercises into a single applicaiton. These include serial communitation, I2C protocol f or sensing, and designing systems with variable time-based behavior.</p>
