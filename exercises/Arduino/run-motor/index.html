    <h2>Exercise: Run Motor</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Drive a DC motor from an Arduino program.</p>

    <p>A DC motor is a starting point for controlling physical motion.  By
      itself, a DC motor spins fast with low torque, so they are usually coupled
      with a mechanical transmission.  If the transmission is an integrated
      gearbox, it is called <em>gearmotor</em>.  This example also works with
      gearmotors, which are useful for driving practical loads with a minimum of
      mechanical fabrication.</p>

    <p>Unlike the bulb, the DC motor is polarized, and reversing the current
      will reverse the direction of motion.  The circuit in this exercise is
      unipolar, and can only drive current through the motor in one direction.
      It is possible, however, to vary the motor speed by turning the transistor
      drive on and off rapidly to vary the <em>average</em> current through the
      motor.  This is called <em>pulse-width modulation</em>, or PWM.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Adjust the motor power supply for a safe full-speed voltage. (Many lab
	motors run on less than than the 12V drawn on the schematic.)</li>
      <li>Load and run the Blink sketch. NOTE: the circuit below has the gate of the transistor plugged into
          pin 9. For the blink sketch you will need to rewire this to 13 (and then back to 9
          when you run the fade sketch below).</li>
      <li>Note that pin 13 is still connected to the onboard LED.  Observe the motor and LED activity.</li>
      <li>This time, explore the limits of timing.  How short a pulse will still create movement?</li>
      <li>Load the Fade sketch, which uses <code>analogWrite()</code> to create a PWM waveform on pin 9.</li>
      <li>Rewire the transistor gate to pin 9.</li>
      <li>Observe the change in motor motion.</li>
      <li>Observe the PWM signal on pin 9 using the oscilloscope.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>The Arduino PWM run at a very audible 490&#160;Hz frequency.  Commercial
      motor drivers usually run at 20&#160;kHz or higher so the noise is above
      the range of human hearing.</p>

    <p>Even though the PWM signal is a digital waveform using only LOW and HIGH
      voltage levels, it is still an analog encoding.  A PWM signal encodes a
      single numeric value in the <em>duty cycle</em>, the ratio of ON time to
      the cycle time, and there is no intrinsic discretization to a pulse width.
      The Arduino generates the PWM signal using a digital circuit so this
      particular PWM is quantized as a multiple of the CPU clock period, but it
      is also possible to generate PWM signals from analog circuits with no
      intrinsic resolution limit.</p>
