    <h2>Exercise: Digital Read Serial</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>

    <p>Measure a binary physical property as a single-bit number.</p>

    <p>Some devices in the physical world do approximate a digital reality:
      switches are usually either on or off.  But even these devices have
      non-ideal properties reflecting the physical reality, e.g. switch contacts
      can &#8220;bounce&#8221; as they make contact, creating a momentary pulse
      train rather than a clean on/off transition.</p>

    <h4>Steps and observations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Load and run the DigitalReadSerial sketch.</li>
      <li>Observe the numbers printed in the serial monitor as the switch changes state.</li>
      <li>Try to observe switch bounce, e.g. several transitions measured for a single physical transition. 
      Using a pushbutton instead of the switch and getting rid of the delay can help in catching a bounce.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Comments</h4>

    <p>A digital input is essentially a single-bit analog-to-digital converter,
      albeit with an ambiguously defined threshold between the voltages
      representing zero and one.  The digital input sampling rate can be much
      higher than the 10-bit ADC, so much higher frequency digital signals could
      be processed with careful real-time programming.</p>

    <p>A related challenge exercise is
      the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/RCtime">Arduino RCtime
      tutorial</a> in which a photoresistor-capacitor circuit is used to form an
      ad-hoc ADC using a single digital I/O pin.  Multiple bits of conversion
      resolution are obtained from measuring the single input bit over time.</p>
